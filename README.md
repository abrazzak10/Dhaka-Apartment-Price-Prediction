#Dhaka Apartment Price Prediction
This is a Machine Learning project focused on predicting apartment prices in Dhaka city. The goal is to analyze real estate data, clean and visualize it, and build a predictive model for price estimation.

Project Highlights:
1. Data Cleaning – Preprocessed and merged raw data from two different sources.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized key patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
3. Price Prediction – Built a machine learning model to estimate apartment prices.
I took raw data from two different sources and merge them into one.
